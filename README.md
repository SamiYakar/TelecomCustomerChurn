## Scenario to develop end-to-end project:

You have just been hired by a telecom company. A competitor has recently entered the market and is offering an attractive plan to new customers. 
The telecom company is worried that this competitor may start attracting its customers.
You have access to a dataset of the company's customers, including whether customers churned. The telecom company wants to know whether you can use this data to 
predict whether a customer will churn. They also want to know what factors increase the probability that a customer churns.
